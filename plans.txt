tmux:

Potentially, one terminal window for frontend, backend, postgres, nginx logs, etc.

Running 'tmux' command will summon a magic status bar at the bottom

It'll take all those terminals and organize them into an array in the status bar

Navigate between them, split them into panes both horizontally and vertically, and give them all custom names. If it's accidentally closed, that's fine because the session is still running in the background.

Can be controlled with scripting bash code to define sessions programatically 

Has plugins to make config easy:

Install it in the container or on any machine, and open a terminal window & start a new process of any kind. Ctrl+B then C adds a new terminal to the stack and we can navigate between them with Ctrl+B+[index number]. Can also navigate with arrow keys, and split terminals into panes using " for vertical and % for horizontal. 

If accidentally closed, do "tmux ls" to list all active sessions. When you find the one you're looking for you can reattach to it using "tmux attach" and get back to work.

Can also create a bash script to do all of this automatically.
